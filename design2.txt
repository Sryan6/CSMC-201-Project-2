# printBoard(board) prints a connect four board from a list
# 
# Input:    takes in a list to print
# Output:   none, it is a print function

# checkWin(board) determines if there is four in a row somewhere in the code.
# 
# Input:    takes in the updated list
# Output:   a boolean, True if a win condition is met and False if not.

# placeDisk(board, player, choice) if the player is 1, the corresponding _ in
#           the list is replaced with an x and an o for player 2. Puts the
#           choice at the bottom-most open spot
# 
# Input:    the list that represents the board, the choice column to replace
#           the _ in the list, and the player to tell what to replace the _
#           with.
# Output:   returns the updated list of values
